# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project implements an automated attendance system using face recognition with Python. It captures face images, recognizes faces in real-time via a webcam, and logs attendance to an Excel sheet. The system has both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## Features

1.Capture New Face Images via webcam.

2.Real-time Face Recognition with face_recognition library.

3.Excel Attendance Logging (attendance.xlsx).

4.Intuitive GUI for ease of use.

5.Timeout Support for auto-closing attendance after a set time(adjustable , default : 120 seconds).

6. Exit option ("q") during attendance marking.

- Libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `face_recognition`
  - `numpy`
  - `openpyxl`
Install dependencies using:

pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy openpyxl
